iOS app developed using SwiftUI to display top headlines of the day using News API (https://newsapi.org)

## Running the app
You will need a API Key from https://newsapi.org to build this project.

Once you get the API key, create a new file `Constants.swift` and add the following variable with your API key as the value

```swift
let NEWS_API_KEY = "<API KEY HERE>"
```

Once this is done, the app can be built without errors.
